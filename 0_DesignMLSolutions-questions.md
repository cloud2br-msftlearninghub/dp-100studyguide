> [!TIP]
> **Azure Machine Learning Workspace Architecture:**

When a workspace is provisioned, Azure automatically creates supporting resources:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Azure Storage Account** | Store files, notebooks, job metadata, and models |
| **Azure Key Vault** | Securely manage authentication keys and credentials |
| **Application Insights** | Monitor predictive services and track performance |
| **Azure Container Registry** | Store Docker images for ML environments (created when needed) |

> [!TIP]
> **Workspace Creation Methods:**

| Method | Use Case | Complexity |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Azure Portal** | Quick setup, visual interface | Low |  
| **ARM Template** | Infrastructure as Code, repeatable deployments | Medium |
| **Azure CLI** | Automation, scripting, CI/CD pipelines | Medium |
| **Python SDK** | Programmatic control, integration with ML workflows | High |

> [!TIP]
> **Azure ML Security Roles:**

| Role | Permissions | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Owner** | Full access to all resources, can grant access to others | Workspace administrators |
| **Contributor** | Full access to all resources, cannot grant access | Senior data scientists |
| **Reader** | View-only access, cannot make changes | Stakeholders, auditors |
| **AzureML Data Scientist** | All actions except compute management and workspace settings | Standard data scientists |
| **AzureML Compute Operator** | Create, change, and manage compute resources | MLOps engineers |

> [!TIP]
> **Compute Types Comparison:**

| Compute Type | Use Case | Scaling | Cost Model |
|--------------|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Compute Instance** | Interactive development, Jupyter notebooks | Fixed size | Pay per hour while running |
| **Compute Cluster** | Training jobs, batch inference | Auto-scale (0-N nodes) | Pay per node per hour |
| **Kubernetes Cluster** | Production deployments, custom container orchestration | Manual configuration | Bring your own cluster |
| **Attached Compute** | Use existing resources (VMs, Databricks) | External management | External billing |
| **Serverless Compute** | On-demand training jobs | Fully managed | Pay per job execution |

> [!TIP]
> **Workspace Assets:**

| Asset Type | Description | Example Use Case |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Models** | Trained ML models with metadata | Store trained models for deployment |
| **Environments** | Runtime configurations (packages, Docker images) | Ensure reproducible training and inference |
| **Data** | Datasets and data references | Manage training and validation datasets |
| **Components** | Reusable pipeline steps | Build modular ML pipelines |

> [!TIP]
> **Compute Cluster Configuration:**

| Parameter | Description | Considerations |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **size** | VM type (CPU/GPU, memory, storage) | Match compute needs to workload |
| **max_instances** | Maximum number of nodes for scaling | Balance performance vs cost |
| **tier** | Priority level (Dedicated vs Low Priority) | Low Priority = 80% cost savings but no availability guarantee |

## Code Examples

### Creating a Workspace with Python SDK

```python
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Workspace, CustomerManagedKey
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

# Create workspace with customer-managed key
ws = Workspace(
    name="my-workspace",
    location="eastus",
    display_name="My ML Workspace",
    description="Workspace for DP-100 preparation",
    customer_managed_key=CustomerManagedKey(
        key_vault="/subscriptions/<sub-id>/resourcegroups/<rg>/providers/microsoft.keyvault/vaults/<vault>",
        key_uri="<key-identifier-uri>"
    ),
    tags={"purpose": "DP-100", "environment": "development"}
)

# Create the workspace
ml_client = MLClient(
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
    subscription_id="<subscription-id>",
    resource_group_name="<resource-group>",
    workspace_name="<workspace-name>"
)

ml_client.workspaces.begin_create(ws)
```

### Creating a Compute Cluster

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import AmlCompute

compute_cluster = AmlCompute(
    name="cpu-cluster",
    size="Standard_DS3_v2",
    min_instances=0,
    max_instances=4,
    tier="Dedicated",  # or "LowPriority" for cost savings
    idle_time_before_scale_down=120  # seconds
)

ml_client.compute.begin_create_or_update(compute_cluster)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Security**:
   - Use customer-managed keys for sensitive workloads
   - Implement least-privilege access with appropriate roles
   - Enable private endpoints for network isolation

2. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Use Low Priority compute for non-critical workloads
   - Set up auto-shutdown schedules for compute instances
   - Configure appropriate idle time for compute clusters

3. **Organization**:
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Apply tags for cost tracking and governance
   - Create separate workspaces for different environments (dev/test/prod)

4. **Automation**:
   - Use ARM templates or CLI scripts for reproducible deployments
   - Integrate workspace creation into CI/CD pipelines
   - Version control your infrastructure code
