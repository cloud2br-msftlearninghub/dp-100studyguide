## Q1: Hyperparameter Sampling Methods

> You have a large search space with continuous hyperparameters and want to ensure good coverage of the space. Which sampling method should you use?

- [ ] **Grid Sampling** ❌: `Incorrect. Grid sampling only works with discrete parameters.`
- [ ] **Random Sampling** ❌: `Incorrect. While it works, Sobol provides better coverage.`
- [ ] **Sobol Sampling** ✅: `Correct. Sobol sampling provides quasi-random coverage that's more uniform than random sampling.`
- [ ] **Bayesian Sampling** ❌: `Incorrect. Bayesian is better for expensive training scenarios, not necessarily large search spaces.`

## Q2: Early Termination Policies

> You want to terminate hyperparameter tuning runs that perform significantly worse than the best run. Which policy should you use?

- [ ] **Median Stopping Policy** ❌: `Incorrect. This compares against the median, not the best run.`
- [ ] **Truncation Selection Policy** ❌: `Incorrect. This terminates a percentage of runs, not based on comparison to the best.`
- [ ] **Bandit Policy** ✅: `Correct. Bandit policy terminates runs that perform worse than the best run by a specified slack amount.`
- [ ] **No early termination** ❌: `Incorrect. This doesn't address the requirement to terminate poor performers.`

## Q3: Online vs Batch Endpoints

> When should you use a batch endpoint instead of an online endpoint?

- [ ] **When you need real-time predictions with low latency** ❌: `Incorrect. This describes online endpoints.`
- [ ] **When you need to process large datasets asynchronously** ✅: `Correct. Batch endpoints are designed for processing large amounts of data without real-time requirements.`
- [ ] **When you need high availability and auto-scaling** ❌: `Incorrect. Online endpoints provide these features.`
- [ ] **When you need to serve multiple model versions simultaneously** ❌: `Incorrect. Both endpoint types can serve multiple versions.`

## Q4: Model Registration Types

> You have a TensorFlow deep learning model that you want to deploy with NVIDIA Triton Inference Server. Which model type should you register?

- [ ] **MLflow** ❌: `Incorrect. While MLflow supports TensorFlow, Triton provides better performance for deep learning inference.`
- [ ] **Custom** ❌: `Incorrect. Triton is a supported model type in Azure ML.`
- [ ] **Triton** ✅: `Correct. Triton model type is specifically designed for deep learning workloads with TensorFlow and PyTorch.`
- [ ] **Standard** ❌: `Incorrect. This is not a valid model registration type.`

## Q5: Scoring Script Functions

> Which functions are required in a scoring script for model deployment? (Select all that apply)

- [ ] **init()** ✅: `Correct. init() is called when the service starts and is used to load the model.`
- [ ] **run()** ✅: `Correct. run() is called for each inference request and performs the scoring.`
- [ ] **main()** ❌: `Incorrect. main() is not required for Azure ML scoring scripts.`
- [ ] **predict()** ❌: `Incorrect. predict() is not a required function name, though it may be used within run().`

## Q6: Traffic Splitting

> You want to gradually roll out a new model by sending 10% of traffic to the new version and 90% to the current version. How should you configure the traffic split?

- [ ] **{"current": 90, "new": 10}** ✅: `Correct. Traffic values represent percentages and must sum to 100.`
- [ ] **{"current": 0.9, "new": 0.1}** ❌: `Incorrect. Traffic values should be integers representing percentages, not decimals.`
- [ ] **{"current": 9, "new": 1}** ❌: `Incorrect. These values sum to 10, not 100.`
- [ ] **Set new deployment as default** ❌: `Incorrect. This would send all traffic to the new version.`

## Q7: Responsible AI Components

> Which Responsible AI components help you understand feature influence on predictions? (Select all that apply)

- [ ] **Add Explanation to RAI Insights dashboard** ✅: `Correct. Explanations show how features influence predictions.`
- [ ] **Add Causal to RAI Insights dashboard** ❌: `Incorrect. Causal analysis shows causal effects, not direct feature influence.`
- [ ] **Add Counterfactuals to RAI Insights dashboard** ❌: `Incorrect. Counterfactuals show how changes would affect output, not current feature influence.`
- [ ] **Add Error Analysis to RAI Insights dashboard** ❌: `Incorrect. Error analysis identifies error patterns, not feature influence.`

## Q8: Model Evaluation Metrics

> You're building a fraud detection model where missing actual fraud cases is very costly. Which metric should you optimize?

- [ ] **Precision** ❌: `Incorrect. Precision minimizes false positives, not false negatives.`
- [ ] **Recall** ✅: `Correct. Recall minimizes false negatives (missing fraud cases), which is critical for fraud detection.`
- [ ] **Accuracy** ❌: `Incorrect. Accuracy can be misleading with imbalanced fraud datasets.`
- [ ] **F1-Score** ❌: `Incorrect. While F1 balances precision and recall, recall is more important for this use case.`

## Q9: Deployment Configuration

> What information is required to deploy a model to a managed online endpoint? (Select all that apply)

- [ ] **Model assets** ✅: `Correct. The trained model files are required.`
- [ ] **Scoring script** ✅: `Correct. The script that loads the model and performs inference.`
- [ ] **Environment** ✅: `Correct. The runtime environment with necessary packages.`
- [ ] **Compute configuration** ✅: `Correct. VM size and instance count for the deployment.`

## Q10: Batch Scoring Configuration

> You're configuring a batch endpoint to process large datasets in parallel. Which parameters control the parallelization? (Select all that apply)

- [ ] **instance_count** ✅: `Correct. Number of compute nodes for parallel processing.`
- [ ] **max_concurrency_per_instance** ✅: `Correct. Number of parallel processes per compute node.`
- [ ] **mini_batch_size** ✅: `Correct. Number of files processed per scoring script run.`
- [ ] **output_action** ❌: `Incorrect. This controls output format, not parallelization.`

## Best Practices

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Use appropriate sampling methods for your parameter types
   - Implement early termination to save compute costs
   - Start with broader ranges, then narrow down

2. **Model Deployment**:
   - Test deployments in staging before production
   - Use blue-green deployments for safe rollouts. E.g `you want to perform a canary rollout: send 10% of real-time inference requests to blue and 90% to green.` 
        - **“blue”** → the new candidate model  
        - **“green”** → the current production model  
   - Monitor endpoint performance and costs

3. **Responsible AI**:
   - Create RAI dashboards for high-impact models
   - Regular model fairness assessments
   - Document model limitations and assumptions

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Choose appropriate endpoint types for your use case
   - Configure parallelization for batch workloads
   - Monitor and adjust resource allocation
