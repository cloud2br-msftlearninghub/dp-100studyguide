## Q1: Azure AI Services vs Azure AI Foundry

> You're building a generative AI chat application that requires OpenAI models and content safety features. Which resource type should you choose?

- [ ] **Azure AI Services** ❌: `Incorrect. Azure AI Services doesn't include OpenAI models.`
- [ ] **Azure AI Foundry** ✅: `Correct. Azure AI Foundry includes OpenAI models and content safety features specifically for generative AI applications.`
- [ ] **Azure Machine Learning** ❌: `Incorrect. While possible, Azure AI Foundry is specifically designed for this use case.`
- [ ] **Azure Cognitive Services** ❌: `Incorrect. This is the older name for Azure AI Services.`

## Q2: Language Model Evaluation Metrics

> You want to ensure that your language model's responses are factually accurate and align with your knowledge base. Which metric should you prioritize?

- [ ] **Coherence** ❌: `Incorrect. Coherence measures logical flow, not factual accuracy.`
- [ ] **Fluency** ❌: `Incorrect. Fluency measures grammar, not factual accuracy.`
- [ ] **Groundedness** ✅: `Correct. Groundedness measures how well the model's output aligns with the input source or database.`
- [ ] **Similarity** ❌: `Incorrect. Similarity compares to ground truth but doesn't ensure factual accuracy.`

## Q3: RAG vs Fine-tuning

> When should you use RAG instead of fine-tuning for improving model performance?

- [ ] **When you need to change the model's behavior permanently** ❌: `Incorrect. This describes fine-tuning.`
- [ ] **When you want to incorporate up-to-date information from external sources** ✅: `Correct. RAG retrieves current information from external sources before generation.`
- [ ] **When you have a large dataset of example conversations** ❌: `Incorrect. This is better suited for fine-tuning.`
- [ ] **When you need to reduce model inference latency** ❌: `Incorrect. RAG adds retrieval overhead.`

## Q4: Search Methods in RAG

> You're implementing RAG for a system that needs to handle both specific technical terms and natural language queries. Which search method should you use?

- [ ] **Keyword Search only** ❌: `Incorrect. This won't handle natural language queries well.`
- [ ] **Semantic Search only** ❌: `Incorrect. This might miss specific technical terms.`
- [ ] **Vector Search only** ❌: `Incorrect. Similar limitation to semantic search.`
- [ ] **Hybrid Search** ✅: `Correct. Hybrid search combines multiple methods to handle both specific terms and natural language queries.`

## Q5: Fine-tuning Parameters

> You're fine-tuning a language model and want to balance learning speed with stability. You have a large dataset. How should you configure the parameters?

- [ ] **Large batch_size, high learning_rate_multiplier** ❌: `Incorrect. High learning rate with large batches can cause instability.`
- [ ] **Large batch_size, moderate learning_rate_multiplier** ✅: `Correct. Large batch sizes work well with large datasets and provide stable learning with moderate learning rates.`
- [ ] **Small batch_size, high learning_rate_multiplier** ❌: `Incorrect. Small batches with high learning rates can be very unstable.`
- [ ] **Small batch_size, low learning_rate_multiplier** ❌: `Incorrect. This would be very slow for large datasets.`

## Q6: Responsible AI Framework

> What is the correct order of the four stages in Microsoft's Responsible AI framework for generative models?

- [ ] **Measure, Map, Mitigate, Manage** ❌: `Incorrect. You need to identify harms before measuring them.`
- [ ] **Map, Measure, Mitigate, Manage** ✅: `Correct. First identify potential harms, then measure their presence, implement safeguards, and manage responsibly.`
- [ ] **Mitigate, Map, Measure, Manage** ❌: `Incorrect. You need to understand the problems before implementing solutions.`
- [ ] **Manage, Map, Measure, Mitigate** ❌: `Incorrect. Management comes after implementing safeguards.`

## Q7: Model Benchmarks

> You want to evaluate how well your model's generated text matches the grammatical and syntactic quality of human-written text. Which benchmark should you use?

- [ ] **Accuracy** ❌: `Incorrect. Accuracy is for classification tasks, not text quality.`
- [ ] **Coherence** ❌: `Incorrect. Coherence measures logical flow, not grammar.`
- [ ] **Fluency** ✅: `Correct. Fluency assesses grammatical rules, syntactic structures, and vocabulary usage.`
- [ ] **GPT Similarity** ❌: `Incorrect. This measures semantic similarity, not grammatical quality.`

## Q8: AI Project SDKs

> You're developing a Python application that needs to connect to an Azure AI Foundry project and access multiple AI services. Which SDK should you use?

- [ ] **Azure OpenAI SDK** ❌: `Incorrect. This only provides access to OpenAI services.`
- [ ] **Azure AI Services SDKs** ❌: `Incorrect. These are service-specific, not project-level.`
- [ ] **Azure AI Projects for Python** ✅: `Correct. This SDK enables connection to Azure AI Foundry projects and access to all connected resources.`
- [ ] **Azure Machine Learning SDK** ❌: `Incorrect. This is for traditional ML workflows, not AI Foundry projects.`

## Q9: Foundation Model Selection

> You're choosing a foundation model for fine-tuning. Your task involves processing short text snippets for sentiment analysis. Which consideration is most important?

- [ ] **Model capabilities for short text understanding** ✅: `Correct. Models like BERT are specifically designed for understanding short texts.`
- [ ] **Model size for faster inference** ❌: `Incorrect. While important, capability alignment is more critical.`
- [ ] **Pretraining data size** ❌: `Incorrect. Data quality and relevance matter more than size.`
- [ ] **Model popularity in the community** ❌: `Incorrect. Task alignment is more important than popularity.`

## Q10: Prompt Engineering Techniques

> You want to improve your language model's performance without fine-tuning or changing the model. Which approach should you use first?

- [ ] **Implement RAG immediately** ❌: `Incorrect. RAG adds complexity; try simpler approaches first.`
- [ ] **Use prompt engineering techniques** ✅: `Correct. Prompt engineering is quick, easy, and often very effective for improving model performance.`
- [ ] **Fine-tune the model** ❌: `Incorrect. Fine-tuning is more complex and resource-intensive.`
- [ ] **Switch to a larger model** ❌: `Incorrect. This increases costs without addressing the root issue.`

    search_results = search_client.search(
        search_text=query,
        search_mode="hybrid",  # Combines keyword and semantic search
        top=3
    )
    
    context = "\n".join([result["content"] for result in search_results])
    
    # Generate response with context

print(f"Fine-tuning job created: {job.id}")

# Monitor job status
while job.status not in ["succeeded", "failed", "cancelled"]:
    job = project_client.fine_tuning.jobs.retrieve(job.id)
    print(f"Status: {job.status}")
    time.sleep(30)
```

        # Log safety metrics
        log_safety_metrics(prompt, response)
        
        return response.choices[0].message.content
    except Exception as e:
        log_safety_violation(prompt, str(e))
